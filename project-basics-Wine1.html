    <p>
        <strong> Red wine </strong> is made from the must (pulp, including the juice) of red or black grapes and
        fermentation occurs together with the grape skins, which give the wine its color.
        <br /><strong> White wine</strong>
        is made by fermenting juice which is made by pressing crushed grapes to extract a juice; the skins are removed
        and play no
        further role.
        <br />
        <br />
        To start primary <span>fermentation</span>, yeast <em> may be added </em> to the must for red wine, or <em> may
            occur naturally </em> as ambient yeast on
        the grapes (or in the air). For white wine, yeast <em> may </em> be added to the juice. During this
        <span>fermentation</span> , which often takes
        between one and two weeks, the yeast converts most of the sugars in the grape juice into ethanol (alcohol)
        and
        carbon dioxide (which is lost to the atmosphere).
        <br />
        This process is also known as "<span>alcoholic fermentation</span>"
        and is a vital step in the winemaking process, as it
        helps to shape the wine's flavor, aroma, and appearance.
